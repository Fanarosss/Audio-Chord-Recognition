    "<b>Idea: </b> Instead of having one hot vectors of size N, where N is the number of unique chords in the dataset, we will connect the notes with the chords. Meaning, a <b>G</b> chord is comprised of a G, B and a D. <b>G7</b> is comprised of G,B,D,F. <b>C#</b> is comprised of C#,E#(F),A#. Etc.<br>\n",
